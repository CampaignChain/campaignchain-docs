Call to Action Configuration
============================

To enable :ref:`CTA tracking <dev-book-overview-cta>` for a Channel, follow these steps:

1. Connect Channel
------------------

In the CampaignChain header menu, click the *Create New* button and select *Location*.

Then, choose the appropriate Location from the drop-down list, e.g. *Website* to
include a Website into CTA tracking.

Fill in the required data to connect the Channel. For example, provide the
base URL of a Website (you can omit adding pages of the Website).

Once you're done, CampaignChain will display a list of connected Channels to
you. This list will include the unique Channel Tracking ID that has been assigned
by CampaignChain to your new Channel. You will need this ID in the next step.

2. Include Tracking Code
------------------------

2.1 Directly within HMTL Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you own the Channel you plan to include and you also have full control
to directly manipulate the HTML source, then you can include a JavaScript file
provided by CampaignChain an all of your Channel's pages.

The file is named *campaignchain_tracking.js* and once you have it included, it
will take care of sending all the information for tracking CTAs to your
CampaignChain instance.

Include the file by adding the code mentioned below to your channel, ideally 
right before the closing body element (i.e. *</body>* element) and make sure that
it appears on all pages of the Channel.

2.2 Use Google Tag Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you can't access the Channel or instead of waiting months for someon else
to update the code of a Channel, Google Tag Manager (GTM) comes to the rescue. It 
lets you launch new tags with just a few clicks. GTM supports container snippets,
a small piece of JavaScript or non-JavaScript code that it includes into your pages.

Google Tag Manager allows you to create a new *Custom HTML Tag* at the `GTM Web 
interface`_. Paste the CampaignChain tracking code into the *HMTL* section. Make 
sure the event is fired on all pages. The last step  is to publish your new tag in
GTM. 

2.3. The CampaignChain Tracking Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Independently from placing the tracking code diretly to the HTML source or using GTM,
here is how CampaignChain's JavaScript tracking code looks like:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="[CAMPAIGNCHAIN INSTALLATION]/bundles/campaignchaincore/js/campaignchain/campaignchain_tracking.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var campaignchainChannel = '[CAMPAIGNCHAIN CHANNEL TRACKING ID]';
    </script>

Replace ``[CAMPAIGNCHAIN INSTALLATION]`` with the URL of the root of your CampaignChain
installation, e.g. *http://www.example.com/bundles/campaignchaincore/js/campaignchain/campaignchain_tracking.js*.

Next, replace ``[CAMPAIGNCHAIN CHANNEL TRACKING ID]`` with the ID generated by
CampaignChain for your channel.
