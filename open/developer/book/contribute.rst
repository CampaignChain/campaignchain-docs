Contributing to CampaignChain
=============================

If you would like to add new functionality or fix a bug in CampaignChain, you
are more than welcomed!

In general, we follow the best practices of open-source collaboration and
developed some of our own - which is mostly due to the fact that CampaignChain
is highly modular.

Find below some guidelines and we'd appreciate if you followed them. Should you
have questions, please `contact us`_.

Symfony
-------

We closely follow the contribution guidelines of the Symfony project. Please
make yourself acquainted with:

* `Coding standards`_
* `Code conventions`_

GitHub
------

We use `GitHub`_ to develop the CampaignChain Open Edition. It allows us to
collaborate with developers world-wide.

Please follow these guidelines:

Issues
~~~~~~

Always create an issue for the task you are working on at https://github.com/CampaignChain/campaignchain-custom/issues.

Commit Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Git commit message should point to the issue you are working on. The syntax
is:

.. code-block::

    CampaignChain/campaignchain#{issue-number} {issue-title}

In `PHPStorm`_, you can use below definition
for the commit message field when configuring the GitHub server to retrieve
issues within PHPStorm:

.. code-block::

    CampaignChain/{project}#{number} {summary}

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Never commit directly to the ``master`` branch of CampaignChain or its modules.
Instead, please :ref:`create branches <dev-book-contribute-branching>`. That way
we can first test your contributions in the branch, ask you for changes, and
then merge them with the ``master`` branch.

What's great about GitHub is that it `let's you easily create pull requests`_
and then comment on it, `even on single lines of the code`_.

So, once you are done with your changes and they are all committed to your
branch, please create a pull request and we'll review it.

.. _dev-book-contribute-branching:

Branching
---------

Whenever you create a new feature for CampaignChain or want to contribute a bug
fix, please create a new branch of the respective CampaignChain module(s) or
Symfony bundles you are working on.

Also, make sure you create a new branch of the `CampaignChain/campaignchain`_
application as well.

How to Create a Branch?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not familiar with Git and branching, please read the introduction
`Basic Branching and Merging`_.

The name of the branch should include ``campaignchain-`` and the number of the
related issue, such as ``campaignchain-42``.

Inline Alias in composer.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define in the ```composer.json```_(https://github.com/CampaignChain/campaignchain/blob/master/composer.json)
file of the application, which branched modules/bundles you'd like to use for
development. Just list them in the ``require-dev`` section and define the
branch as a `Composer inline alias`_.

Here's an example how to do it for your custom module/bundle:

.. code-block:: yaml
    "require-dev": {
        "acme/my-bundle": "my-branch as dev-master"
    },

If you are working on existing CampaignChain modules, e.g. to fix a bug, create
a branch and define it as an inline alias. All `Composer version constraints`_
defined elsewhere will be overridden.

.. code-block:: yaml
    "require-dev": {
        "campaignchain/core": "my-branch as dev-master"
    },

Modify Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please modify the :ref:`sample data <dev-book-contribute-sample-data>` accordingly
by changing existing fixtures or by adding those which allow others to test new
features.

Branching Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We structure the flow of our development Ã s follows:

* The ``master`` branch holds the latest stable code.
* New features are being developed in separate branches.
* Release branches hold the code of the tagged ``master` branch.

.. _dev-book-contribute-sample-data:

Sample Data
-----------

When you are developing with CampaignChain, sample data will be available
automatically. Learn how to :doc:`import sample data to the system </open/developer/book/sample_data>`.

To allow testing of your changes by others, please keep all the publicly available
:ref:`sample data packages <dev-book-sample-data-packages>` in sync with your
branch.

License
-------

All code developed for the CampaignChain Open Edition is available under the
`Apache License`_. We ask all
contributors to assign new code to the same license.

Please add a ``LICENSE`` file with the `content of the Apache License`_ into the
