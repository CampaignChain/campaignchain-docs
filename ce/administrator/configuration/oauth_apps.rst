OAuth Apps
==========

Create new OAuth Apps
---------------------

To allow CampaignChain to post to Twitter, Facebook and some more Channels, it
must be able to access the REST APIs of such Channels. Hence, CampaignChain
must be registered as an App with these Channels to receive an App Key and App
Secret.

There are How-Tos available for each Channel:

- `Twitter OAuth app configuration`_

Edit existing OAuth App credentials
-----------------------------------

The App Keys and Secrets of Channels which have already been connected with
CampaignChain, can be edited as follows:

In the CampaignChain header menu, click the *Settings* icon and select *OAuth
Client Apps*.
