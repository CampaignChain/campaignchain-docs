Platform.sh
===========

This is a step-by-step guide on how to deploy CampaignChain Enterprise Edition
on Platform.sh.

CampaignChain Enterprise Edition can be installed out-of-the-box on Platform.sh,
either for production or development.

What's great about Platform.sh is that you can hook it up with GitHub to
automatically re-build and update CampaignChain on a Platform.sh server as soon
as changes to the code have been pushed to GitHub.

Create a New Project
--------------------

First, you create a new Platform.sh project by following these steps:

#.  `Select a Platform.sh plan`_. Select "Development" if you would like to
    use Platform.sh as a live development environment or another plan if you'd
    like to use it for a production site.
